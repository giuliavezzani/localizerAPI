# localizerAPI
This repository includes the API developed during my master thesis. The API provides the C++ implementation of two algorithms for the solution of a 3D tactile localization problem: the Scaling Series algorithm, modified to work with only contact point measurements , and the Memory Unscented Particle Filter.
